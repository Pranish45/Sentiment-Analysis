## 🛠️ Features
- Text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.)
- Sentiment classification using ML algorithms
- Visual representation of sentiment distribution
- Supports CSV-based dataset input
- Easily extendable for custom datasets

## 📂 Project Structure
- `sentiment_model.ipynb` – Main notebook for training & testing
- `data/` – Folder for dataset files (CSV format)
- `visualizations/` – Charts & graphs of sentiment trends
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies for the project

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
